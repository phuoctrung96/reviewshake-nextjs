      <ContentTitle as={'h1'}>Reviewshake vs Repuso</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>Let’s see how Reviewshake compares to Repuso.</ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Repuso offers a simple solution to collect all your reviews from social media and other
        websites to showcase them on your website to build trust through social proof. However,
        aside from generating and marketing your reviews this way, Repuso lacks in other areas such
        as review management and review analysis.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Pricing</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Repuso’s pricing structure is quite unusual. Its basic plan starts from only $9 per month.
        However, the features of this plan are very basic. This plan only allows 2 widgets, and
        there are no integrations. It offers add-ons for additional features like additional
        accounts and video reviews. However, these add-ons lead to an expensive subscription.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake’s plans start from $31 per month. While more expensive, it offers much more in
        the way of features. It includes video reviews, 300 emails, 30 SMS invites, and more.

        Repuso collects reviews from social media and other websites. It allows users to showcase
        them through their website&aspo;s widgets. Users can approve testimonials to appear on their
        websites and use the drag-and-drop feature to change the reviews’ positions.

        customers to increase trust in your brand.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Manage Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Repuso allows you to approve your reviews to choose those you would like to share on your
        website. You can choose to hide those that don’t show your business in the best light.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        However, Reviewshake segments your positive and negative reviews for you, so you can
        pinpoint the areas you need to improve on. You can also reply to reviews on Google and
        Facebook directly from the platform, so it’s easy to manage your reviews in one space.

        resell its software to your clients.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Both Reviewshake and Repuso have a two-way SMS inbox that lets you easily communicate
        directly with customers. This means you can easily mediate bad reviews and thank customers
        who leave kind ones.

      <ContentText>Repuso doesn&apos;t offer users review analyzing tools.</ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        On the other hand, Reviewshake creates reports that look at your business locations or
        competitors side-by-side. This way, you can easily view where you’re lacking in certain
        locations or compare to your competitors. Since you don’t need to waste time creating
        reports, you can get straight down to fixing the problem at hand.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Market Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        With Reviewshake, you can share your best reviews automatically to your social media to help
        you gain new leads. Plus, you can showcase your reviews on your website’s landing page to
        immediately build trust with your customers.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Repuso doesn&apos;t offer the same level of marketing features. While it does showcase your
        reviews to your website to build trust through social proof, it doesn&apos;t share reviews
        to your social media to gain leads outside of customers who go on to your website.
