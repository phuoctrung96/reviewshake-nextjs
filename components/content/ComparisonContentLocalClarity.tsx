        customers leaving a review and will improve your overall ratings.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Market Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake beats Local Clarity when it comes to marketing your reviews. While Local Clarity
        focuses on improving your presence on Google and tries to help potential customers locate
        you through searching, it doesn’t market your reviews to any other platforms that could help
        your business be found by people not directly looking for your business by name.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        On the other hand, Reviewshake automatically shares your best reviews on your social media
        to help improve your reputation and can get leads from customers who haven’t searched for
        you. You can also showcase your best reviews on your website so that you can build trust
        with potential customers.
