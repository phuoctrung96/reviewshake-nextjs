      <ContentTitle as={'h1'}>Reviewshake vs Testimonial</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>Let’s see how Reviewshake compares to Testimonial.</ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Having used both platforms, Reviewshake has a much wider range of features than Testimonial.
        While Testimonial offers a simple solution to showcase your written and video testimonials,
        it doesn&apos;t offer the same in-depth reputation management tools.
      </ContentText>

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Testimonial</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Testimonial allows you to display your written or video testimonials on your company’s
        landing page to display them to your prospective clients.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        It has an easy-to-use interface and dashboard. It offers a very simple solution for you to
        get testimonials from your customers and manage them in one space.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        I really liked its ‘Wall of Love’ feature, where you can display your testimonials publicly
        on your landing page. You can showcase your video, text, and Twitter shoutouts here.

      <ContentText>
        However, Testimonial doesn&apos;t manage, sort, or analyze your reviews like Reviewshake
        does. While it offers a simple solution to get testimonials from your customers, it
        doesn&apos;t help you manage your positive and negative reviews and keep on top of your
        online feedback, so you have to spend time sifting through your testimonials.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        So while you can easily get the testimonials from your customers and display them on your
        site, you will have to manually monitor the reviews your receive and manually share them on
        your social media websites.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Reviewshake</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake is a comprehensive reputation management platform that monitors your reviews
        from 85+ review sites.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Like Testimonial, I found it very easy to use. However, I found the onboarding process much
        more intuitive. Despite offering a wide array of services, it doesn&apos;t overwhelm you
        during the onboarding process. It clearly sets out its features in a simple way so you
        understand exactly what you can get from Reviewshake.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake also segments your positive and negative reviews so it’s easier to keep track
        and take action as soon as you receive a negative review. Plus, its review notification
        feature means you won’t miss any reviews coming through.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Like Testimonial, you can request text and video reviews from your customers. You can also
        showcase your reviews on your company’s landing page, so prospective customers will
        immediately be presented with a sea of your happy customers.
