      <ContentTitle as={'h1'}>Reviewshake vs GatherUp</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Let’s see how Reviewshake compares to GatherUp (formerly GetFiveStars).
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        GatherUp offers a comprehensive and automated solution to generate, manage, market, and
        analyze reviews. Overall, it’s a very strong contender within the review management space.
        But how does it compare to Reviewshake?
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Having used and tested out both Reviewshake and GatherUp platforms, Reviewshake comes out on
        top for a few reasons.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        This is mainly due to Reviewshake’s ability to request and generate both video and written
        reviews, whereas GatherUp only does text reviews. Reviewshake was also more affordable than
        GatherUp when I compared two similar plans.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Pricing</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        GatherUp is not as clear on its pricing structure as Reviewshake. GatherUp offers three
        pricing plans on its website suitable for businesses. However, agencies and enterprises have
        to make an inquiry to find out how much their plan would cost.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Comparing two similar plans, Reviewshake seems to be better value. For the one-user plan,
        you can start with Reviewshake for only $31 per month, compared to $99 for a similar
        one-user plan for GatherUp. Prices become more economical as you scale up. But for smaller
        businesses, Reviewshake is the clear winner when it comes to value.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Managing Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake and GatherUp both allow you to manage reviews from 85+ websites. You can also
        use the white label feature to resell the software to your clients.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        With Reviewshake and GatherUp, you can reply to reviews on Google or Facebook directly from
        the platform, so you have complete management over your reviews from one space.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Generating Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Both Reviewshake and GatherUp offer a simple solution to request and manage reviews.
        However, unlike Reviewshake, GatherUp doesn&asos;t let customers leave video reviews, nor
        does it filter customers to re-engage those who meet the criteria.

      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake also gives you an overview of each customer&aspo;s timeline to easily manage
        your relationship with your customers.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Marketing Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake and GatherUp both market your best reviews to social media for you.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        You can also have your positive reviews displayed on your website, so your potential
        customers can gain a better understanding of your other customers’ results.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Analyzing Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Both platforms offer different reporting that analyzes your reviews, so it’s easier for you
        to keep on top of your feedback. Both platforms show side-by-side business location reports.
        However, with Reviewshake, you can also see your reports alongside your competitors, so you
        can easily see the areas you need to improve on.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Usability</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        When I started using GatherUp, the features were clearly laid out, and it had a simple user
        interface. However, I experienced a lot of pop-ups about the different features. While this
        was a good way to learn about the different features, it was a little frustrating to be
        bombarded when it was already relatively clear.

      <ContentText>
        On the other hand, Reviewshake also had a simple and easy-to-use interface, with the option
        to view tutorials if you wanted to learn more about any features.
