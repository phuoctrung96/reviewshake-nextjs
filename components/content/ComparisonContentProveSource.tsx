      <ContentTitle as={'h1'}>Reviewshake vs ProveSource</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>Let’s see how Reviewshake compares to ProveSource.</ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        From my testing, both platforms offer good features that can help your business grow through
        reviews. However, they have different focuses. ProveSource focuses on gaining customers
        through social proof to boost conversion. In contrast, Reviewshake focuses on being a
        comprehensive review management platform.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        ProveSource is a great platform for what it does, but it doesn&apos;t offer as many features
        as Reviewshake. If you’re looking for a platform that automatically manages, generates,
        analyzes, and markets reviews all in one place, Reviewshake is the ideal platform for you.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Pricing</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake and ProveSource offer different features in their plans, so their pricing
        structures are very different. ProveSource’s plans are based on the number of visitors to
        your site per month. It offers a free plan for up to 1,000 visitors, and its paid plans
        start from $18 per month for up to 10,000 visitors and go up from there.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        When you surpass the number of visitors for your plan, ProveSource will stop showing
        notifications to your visitors until the next month or until you upgrade.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake offers plans suitable for a range of businesses — from small businesses to
        enterprises and agencies. You can get started with Reviewshake for as little as $31 per
        month.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Generate Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        ProveSource itself doesn&apos;t help generate reviews for you. It integrates review sources
        and showcases them on your website through notifications.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        On the other hand, Reviewshake offers a simple solution to generate text and video reviews.
        It also uses drip campaigns to automatically remind customers who haven’t left a review to
        help improve your ratings on Google and Facebook.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Manage Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake manages reviews from 85+ websites. It also segments your positive and negative
        reviews so you can pinpoint the area you need to improve on. With Reviewshake, you can also
        reply to reviews on Google and Facebook directly from the platform, so it’s easy to manage
        them in one space.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        ProveSource doesn&apos;t offer this feature. It simply showcases the reviews you have gained
        through popular reviewing sources on your website. So you have to implement your own
        strategies to generate and manage reviews.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Analyze Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake creates reports that look at your business locations or competitors
        side-by-side. This way, you can easily see where you’re lacking in specific locations or
        compare to your competitors, so you don’t need to waste time creating reports. You can get
        straight down to fixing the problem at hand.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        ProveSource also offers an analysis tool. It analyzes your engagement with notifications
        showing your number of visitors, engaged visitors, impressions, hovers, and clicks.

      <ContentText>
        Unfortunately, unlike Reviewshake, ProveSource doesn&apos;t create reports comparing your
        business locations or competitors.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Market Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Marketing is ProveSource’s strong point. It aims to increase conversion by using social
        proof. It displays customer activity and reviews on your website. It shows notifications
        such as how many customers have bought particular items and positive reviews from popular
        review sites like Google and Facebook.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake also has strong marketing tools. Similarly, it uses social proof to gain leads.
        It automatically shares your positive reviews on social media and also showcases your top
        reviews on your company’s landing page.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Final thoughts</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake and ProveSource both aim to boost conversion using social proof. However, they
        have different methods of doing this. Reviewshake offers a comprehensive reputation
        management solution. It allows you to generate text and video reviews, and you can easily
        manage your reviews through its easy-to-use dashboard. Reviewshake also markets your reviews
        automatically and creates detailed reports.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        ProveSource also successfully uses social proof to boost your engagement and conversion, but
        it doesn&aspo;t offer the same amount of features as Reviewshake.
