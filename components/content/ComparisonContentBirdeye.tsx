      <ContentTitle as={'h1'}>Reviewshake vs Birdeye</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>Let’s see how Reviewshake compares to Birdeye.</ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Birdeye is a huge name in the reputation management space, and for good reasons. It offers a
        simple solution to get and manage your customer reviews. But how does it stack up against
        Reviewshake?
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        Both platforms are pretty much neck-in-neck for managing, analyzing, and marketing reviews.
        However, the main differences are the prices of services and the kind of reviews they can
        generate. Birdeye doesn’t provide pricing information openly, so you have to inquire about
        getting a quote. Birdeye also doesn’t let customers leave video reviews, only text reviews.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Pricing</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Birdeye is not very clear on pricing plans. It offers Standard, Professional, and Premium
        plans, but you need to input your business information to see how much it would cost.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        I found I could sign up for a basic plan with Birdeye as a small business for $299 per
        month, whereas you can sign up for Reviewshake for as little as $31 per month. It seems
        Birdeye caters mainly to larger businesses. However, Reviewshake has affordable plans
        suitable for small businesses as well as plans for multinational businesses, agencies and
        enterprises.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Manage Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Both Reviewshake and Birdeye offer strong features to allow you to manage reviews. With both
        platforms, you can see your reviews segmented between positive and negative, so you can see
        the areas your business really needs to work on.

      <ContentTitle as={'h2'}>Generate Reviews</ContentTitle>
      <ContentText>
        Reviewshake and Birdeye offer solutions for you to get reviews from your customers. They
        will send review requests and have drip campaigns to follow up on customers who haven’t left
        a review yet.
      </ContentText>
      <ContentText>
        The big difference between Reviewshake and Birdeye is that Reviewshake allows customers to
        leave video reviews. Having video reviews can feel much more authentic compared to text
        reviews, as potential customers can get a much better sense of how happy your customers are
        with your business.

        strong new channel for driving up conversions.
